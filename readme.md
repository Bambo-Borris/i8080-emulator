# Project Goals

Produce 3 individual software tools:
  - Intel 8080 CPU Emulator (basic functionality?)
  - Intel 8080 Assembler (take i8080 asm -> binary file to be run by emulator)
  - Intel 8080 Disassembler (potentially gets rolled into the 8080 assembler tool as a mode)

# How to run

Open terminal and do:

```
./build.ps1 # Windows
./build.sh # Linux
```
